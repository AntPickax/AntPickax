AntPickax
---------

[**AntPickax**](https://antpick.ax/) includes open source software products which are necessary for Internet services in Yahoo! JAPAN. It includes basic libraries, components and systems.

[**AntPickax**](https://antpick.ax/) is a series of a challenging product that made it easy to solve complicated problems. We hope [**AntPickax**](https://antpick.ax/) products are widely used and create next innovations!

We will keep challenging to publish new open source software as a [**AntPickax**](https://antpick.ax/) product(like an **Ant** working with **pickax**).

### **Background**
Though we use and contribute a lot of open source software in Yahoo! JAPAN, we have started producing the [**AntPickax**](https://antpick.ax/) with the following background.
- Basic functions that are necessary internally are not sufficient.
- Adopting a new architecture to drastically reduce operating costs.
- Performance (mainly speed and scalability) is insufficient.
- License restrictions, it can not be introduced inside the company.

Among the created software, we have released software as an [**AntPickax**](https://antpick.ax/) product that has performance comparable to that of existing OSS and has useful functions not found in existing OSS.
